### Next Week's Goals

Quantized, the key points are

1. [Saket]                  Try ARCADE programs
2. [Varnika, Akash]    Evaluate scope for tool improvement in Paprika
3. [Varnika, Akash]    Research alternate tools to Paprika

### Discussions/Issues

We have to look at alternate possibilities instead of Paprika.
Proper extensions to ARCADE can be decided after hands on experience with the tool
