[Week 1](##Week-1)

[Week 2](##Week-2)

[Week 3](##Week-3)


## WEEK-1
The first week - The project was introduced. This week, we want to
1. Research the domains of Testing and Architecture design
2. Explore tools in the domain
3. Propose extensions

Since the goals this week are exploratory, we are not assigning time deadlines.

## WEEK-2

### Previous Week's Goals:
Our main goal last week was to find existing research in both domains, explore tools, and propose 2 tools for extension.

### Accomplishments
We sucessfully completed last week's tasks,

### Next Week's Goals

Quantized, the key points are

1. [Saket]                  Try ARCADE programs
2. [Varnika, Akash]    Evaluate scope for tool improvement in Paprika
3. [Varnika, Akash]    Research alternate tools to Paprika

### Discussions/Issues

We have to look at alternate possibilities instead of Paprika.
Proper extensions to ARCADE can be decided after hands on experience with the tool


## Week-3

Briefly, the key plan decided last week included:
1. Running ARCADE. 
2. Finding how to change Paprika/ looking for alternatives.
